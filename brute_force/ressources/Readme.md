This is the first and easiest method to find website admin panel or admin login page. You can add some words after the URL.Like
www.site.com/admin

www.site.com/administrator

www.site.com/login

www.site.com/wp-login.php

www.site.com/admin.php

So I found /admin and i used brute forcce in this path and i get
Username : Admin Password: shadow
