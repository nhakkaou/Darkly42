# How I found it

When we Used robots.txt we found two folder

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden
```

in /.hidden there is a lot of link and in every link there is a Readme for this reason i created a script to read all those readme
and we found the flag 99dde1d35d1fdd283924d84e6d9f1d820
